## What is this app?

Inspired by [this game](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.frozax.tentsandtrees) of Frozax Games, Tents and Trees is the first video game I developped at Ironhack. 

## What are the rules?
Tents and Trees is a game where the player has to complete a grid by placing tents and grass. Trees are present on the grid and the player must assign each tree a tent. The tent must be on an adjacent square, but not diagonally. Finally, the player must respect the number of tents that must be included in the rows and columns of the grid. The number around the grid are there to help you out!
Be careful tho, tents must not be next to each other or diagonally to another tent.
